# legacy-chimera1n
*Old Chimera1n Deploy for ease of access*

---

> How do I install?

Download the chimera1n deployment script and run in terminal with "sudo bash" with a freshly jailbroken device with checkra1n (don't open the launcher app) (macOS and linux only)



> Why? Isn't there odysseyra1n, why not just use that?

Odysseyra1n uses only libhooker for Tweak Injection, which can cause a few issues. For me in particular TetherMe doesn't work on o-ra1n (Some have reported it works for them) So it's just easier to use this. It also uses libhooker for the important low level stuff, so you don't give up any of that core stability.



> Long-Term Usablity and Downsides

chimera1n no longer recieves sileo updates because it uses the Chimera boostrap. And it's time is limited since coolstar has a very shitty record of keeping repo's up for an extended period of time (look at electra, and sileo for checkra1n). Though I plan to host a mirror when Coolstar eventually shuts down the Chimera Repo.



> Compatibility

Chimera1n works on all checkra1n compatibile devices on iOS 13 -> 13.4 (maybe 13.4.1 -> 13.7 and maybe ? some versions of iOS 12 ?)
