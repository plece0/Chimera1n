## Background
Since the chimera1n bootstrap has been completely replaced with o-ra1n. I thought I might as well reupload it. (simply reverting the o-ra1n github repo doesn't give chimera1n)

## Installation
Jailbreak an iOS 13 device with checkra1n, don't open the loader app and connect to your pc.

- Download the deployment script
- Run the deployment script with "sudo bash"
- Do everything it tells you to
- Profit.

**This will (probably) not work on iOS 14+, don't bother trying.**

## Issues
### Whenever I press the Releases tab in Sileo it crashes!
Revert to an older version of Sileo (debs are in this repo). Sileo 1.9 is broken for some reason.

*Full Credit to Coolstar and the Electra Team for creating the Bootstrap and deployment script, All I did was reupload everything and redirect a few links in the script itself.*
**Sidenote: When the Chimera repo eventually goes down (Look at Electra), I will reupload that as well.**
