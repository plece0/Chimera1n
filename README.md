## Background
This contains a copy of the chimera1n jailbreak, which is basically just the Chimera Bootstrap on checkra1n.
I'd recommend just using Odysseyra1n as it is compatible with more recent versions of Sileo.

## Installation
Jailbreak an iOS 12 -> 13 device with checkra1n (make sure it is beta 0.10.2 or earlier!), don't open the loader app and leave your device connected to your PC.
(The Bootstrap itself supports iOS 11 -> 13)

- Download the deployment script
- Run the deployment script with "sudo bash"
- Do everything it tells you to
- Profit.

**This will not work on iOS 14+.**

## Issues
### Whenever I press the Releases tab in Sileo it crashes!
This has actually been fixed, so feel free to update sileo to the latest compatible version (or just use odyssyra1n lmao).

*Full Credit to Coolstar and the Electra/Chimera Team for creating the Bootstrap and deployment script, All I did was reupload everything and redirect a few links in the script to this repo.*
**If there are any missing packages, see my other repo "Chimera_Repo_Backup" that has all the debs you need to get this jb or Electra working properly.**
