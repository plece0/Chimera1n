# legacy-chimera1n
*Old Chimera1n Deploy for ease of access*

---

# How do I install?

Download the chimera1n deployment script and run in terminal with "sudo bash" with a freshly jailbroken device with checkra1n (don't open the launcher app) (macOS and linux only)



# Why? Isn't there odysseyra1n, why not just use that?

There isn't a real reason for this. Just use subcursus or odysseyra1n lmao.


# Long-Term Usablity and Downsides

chimera1n no longer recieves sileo updates (stuck on 1.9) because it uses the Chimera boostrap. And it's time is limited since coolstar has a very shitty record of keeping repo's up for an extended period of time (look at electra, and sileo for checkra1n). Though I plan to host a mirror when Coolstar eventually shuts down the Chimera Repo.



# Compatibility

Chimera1n works on all checkra1n compatibile devices on iOS 13 -> 13.4 (maybe 13.4.1 -> 13.7 and maybe ? some versions of iOS 12 ?)



All Credit goes to Coolstar for creating this, I take no credit for any of this, besides modding the deployment script.
